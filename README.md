#
##############################################################


## The composition of the working equipment:

```
* STM32F401 (new black pill board) - microcontroller board
* SIM800l - gsp/gprs module (interface uart)
* ATGM332D - gps/glonass module (interface uart)
* SSD1306 - OLED display 0.96 "128x64 (interfaces I2C)
* W25Q64 - flash memory chip with a capacity of 8MB (interfaces spi)
* DS18B20 - temperature sensor (interfaces 1-ware)
```


# Development Tools:

```
* STM32CubeMX - graphic package for creating projects (in C) for microcontrollers of the STM32 family
  (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html).
* System Workbench for STM32 - IDE software development environment for STM32 microcontrollers
  (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html).
* stm32flash - utility for writing firmware to flash memory of STM32 microcontrollers
   via the built-in USART1 port (https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32flash/files/)
* STM32CubeProgrammer - utility for writing firmware to flash memory of STM32 microcontrollers
  (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html).
* ST-LINK V2 - usb debugger for STM8 / STM32 microcontrollers.
* Saleae USB Logic 8ch - logic signal analyzer, 8 channels, max. sampling rate 24MHz
  (https://www.saleae.com/ru/downloads/).
```

# Functional (will be replenished):

* The device uses freeRTOS software:
  - StartDefaultTask - task that support AT-commands nodule SIM800l.
  - StartGps - task that works with GPS data (NMEA) of the ATGM332D module.
* The device initializes some microcontroller interfaces:
  - GPIO : three LEDs are used: PB0,PB9,PB10, one pin (PA0 with button) reset sim800l, pin PB12 - for working sensor DS18B20
  - I2C1 : master mode with a frequency of 400KHz (the bus serves ssd1306).
  - USART1 : parameters of port 115200 8N1 (transmit data with DMA) - a port for logging and receive any commands for control device.
  - USART2 : parameters of port 115200 8N1 (transmit data with DMA) - a port for send AT command to SIM800l module.
  - USART6 : parameters of port 9600 8N1 - the port for receive NMEA data from GPS module ATGM332D.
  - TIM3 : Timer 10 ms. and 1 second, implemented in the callback function.
  - TIM10 : Timer 1 us., for working temperature sensor DS18B20.
  - RTC : real time clock, can be set using the command 'epoch_time=value:time_zone' or via sntp service
  - SPI1 : serves data-flash w25q64 : CS(PA4), SCK(PA5), MISO(PA6), MOSI(PA7) - this chip not used yet.
* The system timer (TIM1) counts milliseconds from the start of operation of the device.
* Data reception on all serial ports (USART1, USART2, USART6) is performed in the callback function of the interrupt handler.
  Received data is transferred to the corresponding tasks through specific queues.
* Support receive sms messages (with concat parts of messages).
* Support FM radio onchip SIM800l.
* Send data (from sensor ds18b20 and gps module atgm332d) to external tcp_server in json format (every 10 sec.)
